Mobile Considerations:

1. Data Usage:
   - Consider adding a "low data mode" option
   - Lazy load videos so they only download when needed

2. Uploading from Mobile:
   - If you're building a CMS, ensure it works on mobile browsers
   - Consider adding a mobile app for easier uploads

3. Playback:
   - Always use the "playsInline" attribute for iOS compatibility
   - Provide clear play/pause controls for touch interfaces
